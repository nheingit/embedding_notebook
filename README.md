to install the dependencies here, you will need to run `poetry install`, if that doesn't work for you, you can also try `poetry install --no-root`

After that, intialize the shell: `poetry shell`

And then kick start the jupyter server by running `jupyter lab`

From there you can use the UI, and run all of the cells to get the data frame vizualizations
